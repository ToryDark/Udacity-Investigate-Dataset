# Project Overview
The project details steps in analyzing a dataset and communicating findings discovered. Python libraries, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib will be used for easier analysis.

# Resources needed or smooth running of project?
Installation of Python, along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
> Installing Anaconda, gives a bit o urge since it comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

# Motivation
The Data Analysis process will be tested and we'll see how everything fits together.
Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib will be used to make writing data analysis code in Python easy.

# Learning Points?
- I have the ability to utilize all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- I have the ability to ask relevant questions and answer them as well given dataset. 
- I am able to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a preerred format
- I have the abilityto communicate the results of my analysis
- I am familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently
- I know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots to show my findings

# Project Details: Introduction & Dataset Description
The Movie Database is an online crowdsourced database for move and television information. The metadata on movies and TV shows is contributed by the 1.1 million-strong community.The dataset contains information about 10,000 movies from the Movie Database (TMDb) with released year from 1966 to 2015, including user ratings and revenue.
The dataset is in a comma-seperated-values (.csv) format. The dataset contains 21 colums and 10866 rows.

# Project Details: Questions Investigated
- What effect does the popularity of a movie have on revenue generation?
- Which of the casts have the most popularity?
- Who among the casts generated the most revenue?
- WWhat are the leading movies based on revenue and budget?

# Project Details: Conclusion
After Investigating the Dataset, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- Popularity has an effect on the revenue that would be generated from movies. As popularity soars, revenue also increases along with it
- Cast with a good amount of popularity also plays a crucial role. Once a cast with a huge popularity is onboarded in translates in the revenue generated.
- Revenue and budget are important parameters to pay attention to in movies. It has a bearing on the outcome of the movie and must be given nuch attention.
